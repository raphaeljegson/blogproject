           <h2>Benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>
           <p>
               The benefit of the IT tools selected are numerous and these as been mentioned
               on previous page 2, the tool have been beneficial towards:
           </p>
         <ul>
            <li>The planning of the project (Trello)</li>
            <li>time management for the project to meet submision deadline</li>
            <li>Coding/Programming/Designing and Execution of the project (HTML,CSS,Visual studio Code</li>
            <li>Hosting,Continuity,Perfromance Monitoring (git GitHub) </li>
         </ul>
            <img src="trelloimg.png" alt="Trello" >
         <p>  
            The bad sides of the selected IT tools are mainly from the fact that 
            they are Native platform Tools which mean thier function is restricted to 
            the Apple device which means i have to learn how to use another version of 
            these tools on other platforms which can confuse a system of assimilation of
               anyone learning.
         </p>
         <h3> Could you have done it in teams? </h3>
         <p> 
            I believe ajdnling this project as an individual as helped more rather 
            than doing it in a team. Single handedly handling this project 
            as given the chance to learn at full lenght the 
            basic functionalitys of the IT tool in use
            doing this porject alos allowed me to showcase my creativity rathert han
            confining to a group idea .

      <h2> Best ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2>
       <p>
          The biggest challenges of this project was time 
          and limited IT tools which did not allow for experimenting
          and trying out other tools to know which woiuld have been best 
          adapted for teh project. The time to practice before actual project was insufficient 
          making it more of a trail or challenge project.

      <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
   <p>   
      Ideally the use of Trello, Slack and GitHub towards 
      any digital project is paramount but it could be more 
      better if other expertise are involved in a didgital 
      project, for example some expert from a third party 
      organisation who is specialised in image or graphics creation 
      which would help in creating desired logos, images and designs
       which can be used for a digital project rather than
        having to source this image or graphical representation 
        via the google which could have legal impact of copy right 
        on this project . 
        would also be very efficient if theres is enough time to learn 
         and use javascript effectively to create more live feel
          and actual functionality on the project .

      <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

       <p> 
          All digital solution should be able to work with out defect on all Operating systems
          and platforms 
          All digital project should be tested for performance making sure 
          all the fucntionaly and featurs work as programmed and specified.
           I shal be testing my website on Firefox and Google Chrome to show charset 
           its compartibility on them . 
           My website will be pushed on GitHub and repositries will reveal
            the process of changes and correction made towards the coding.
