          <h2> Review of the IT tools used for the Website </h2>
          <p>
            The Tools selected for the project were all easy to 
            comprehend and use , although 
            they are newly introduced but in the course of the 
            project they have been very easy
            and enjoyable to use. Understanding the basics and 
            commands of the Tools have
            been far more faster than i thought which makes the 
            whole course interesting. The
            tools have been the best ideal and compatible with the 
            operating system and device in use .   
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate </h2>     
          <p>
          The IT tools selected have been best appropriate to the project as they work well
          with the platform and equipment available for this project.
          The IT tools selected have been very useful in the process 
          and development of the project, The Visual Studio Code has made it possible
          for me to make use of HTML and CSS to design the code for my project.
          </p>
          <p>
          Trello was vital in the process of planning it brought to reality the processes involved in the planning, 
          designing, tasking and execution of the project

          <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
          <p>
            The design of the website is beautiful and the use of CSS was advantageous in 
            adding style, color, format, layout and graphics to the website, 
            There is so much to be done but the time frame in completing the project was 
            limited which reduced the chances of experimenting and creativity.
            Happy with the CSS i have got so far however in the longer run i would  
            make maximum use of CSS to implement signinficant beauty on my projects.
            There is noticebale changes in the layout of the project when viewing from a mobile device 
            i would like to rectify this in the longer run and make sure project 
            gets a uniformed outcome in all platform .

          <h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h2>
          <p>
            Hopefully in live experience there would be more 
             time and team to work with which 
             will make the whole job flow flexible and content full.
             Further improvement on the website would have been 
             the introduction of videos and live displays to 
             add live on the website.
          </p>

        <div>
         <h2>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h2>
         <p>
          After testing the website on two operating systems, the functionality, content,layout, 
          graphics and color of the website remains intact which means that the tools and 
          platform used in deploying the project are fit for purpose and worked well.
