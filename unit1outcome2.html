       <h3> Review of the IT tools used for the Website </h3>
     <p>
        The Tools selected for the project were all easy to 
        comprehend and use , although 
        they are newly introduced but in the course of the 
        project they have been very easy
        and enjoyable to use. Understanding the basics and 
        commands of the Tools have
        been far more faster than i thought which makes the 
        whole course interesting. The
        tools have been the best ideal and compatible with the 
        operating system and device in use .

          <h3>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate </h3>
          The IT tools selected have been best appropriate to the 
          project as they work well
          with the platform and equipment available for the project .
          The IT tools selected have been very useful in the process 
          and development of the 
          project, The visual studio code as made it possible
          for me to make use of HTML and CSS versions to design and design 
          the code for my project . 
          Trello was vital in the process of planning it brought to reality the processes involved in the planning, 
          designing, tasking and execution of the project

         <h3>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
        </div>
        The design of the website is beautiful and 
        the use of CSS was advantageous in 
        added style, color, format, layout and graphics to the website, 
        there is so much to be 
        done but the time frame in completing the project was 
        limited which reduced the chances of experimenting and creativity.

            <h3>Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>
             
            Hopefully in live experience there would be more 
             time and team to work with which 
             will make the whole job flow flexible and content full.
             Further improvement on the website would have been 
             the introduction of videos and live displays to 
             add live on the website .

         After testing the website on two operating systems , 
         the functionality, content , layout 
         , graphics and color of the website remains 
         intact which means that the TOOls and  
         platform used in deploying the project are fit for 
         purpose and worked well .
