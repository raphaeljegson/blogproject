   <H4>Risk That Impacts Digital Projects</H4>
   <p>
       There are numerous risks that may impact the outome of any digital project
       which mainly occurs due to poor planning 
       these risks are narrowed down into two main categories which are Known risks and Unknown risks.
       <br>
       The Known risk are those likely risks that as been identified 
       from the planning stage of the digital project , during the risk assessment and possible solution 
       as been predetermined. 
       <br>
       The unknown risk refer to those risk / mitigations that occurs which is not foreseen or planned for 
       without no known solution for them. 
    <br>
       A good digital project planning process will have the “Known//UnKnown” risks built in.
       This means creating risk mitigation plans (Plan B) along with timing, 
       and budget contingencies.
       <br>
       Cost this could miltigate a digital project as it may require More
       money to tackle new develppments in the course of the project which 
       are not included in the planned budget. A team member might decide to pull out 
       of a project for a new job and this would require momney to hire someone 
       who can fit into the space which is not budgeted for.
       <br> 
       Performance risk this are occurences that may miltigate a digital project
       at the live stage, An over crowded website would have uncontrolable amount of traffic
       which would affect usere experience and may resulting into down time for the website .
