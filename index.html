    <h3>Description of methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects </h3>
    A successfull digital project requires skills and resources using proffesional standard methodology,Tools and specialised techniques 
    to achieve a standardised result. keep mind and focus glued on this blog as i shall be going into 
    details describing these mentioned requirements for your knowledge towards any desired digital project you 
    may want to build in your endeavours. 
<br>
<h4>Planning</h5>
   One major skills required in a digital project is planning , good planning means good foundation with good planning the project as already failed from get go .
   planning will determine what resources is needed, what tool is to be used , what platform best suites the project
   target audience, financial requirment and time frame and maintainance strategies after the project is successfull . 
<br>
   <h4>Communication and Coordination</h4>
   Another important skills is good communication and coordination of the project as a well planned project can encounteer diffuclties and failure 
   if the communication and coordination is porus.Communication brings the teams involved together adequate use of collarative tools 
   such as (slack, Trello,Git Hub, Kanban etc.)to coordinate the process and team is key.
<br>
   <h4>Methodology and Execution</h4>
   The method and execution answers the question of what platform , language ,and style to use in the project, which depends on the project and target audience chosen.
   also the maintainance of the project which are most cost effectiveness to keep it running. not excluding risk assessment and management  
    <div>
        <h4>Plan and Carry out Task using IT Link of Trello Board to be Inluded.</h4>
    </div>  
       <div>
       Trello as been most effective in the planning this project from start to finish it as helped 
        me monitor the work flow of the whole process, moving the Cards 
        to designated places enabled me to visitualise the progress of the project
        and encouraged time management 
        `below is a link to my Trello Board.

    <H4>Risk That Impacts Digital Projects</H4>
       There are numerous risks that may impact the outome of any digital project
       which mainly occurs due to poor planning 
       these risks are narrowed down into two main categories which are Known risks and Unknown risks.
       <br>
       The Known risk are those likely risks that as been identified 
       from the planning stage of the digital project , during the risk assessment and possible solution 
       as been predetermined. 
       <br>
       The unknown risk refer to those risk / mitigations that occurs which is not foreseen or planned for 
       without no known solution for them. 
    <br>
       A good digital project planning process will have the “Known//UnKnown” risks built in.
       This means creating risk mitigation plans (Plan B) along with timing, 
       and budget contingencies.
       <br>
       Cost this could miltigate a digital project as it may require More
       money to tackle new develppments in the course of the project which 
       are not included in the planned budget. A team member might decide to pull out 
       of a project for a new job and this would require momney to hire someone 
       who can fit into the space which is not budgeted for.
       <br> 
       Performance risk this are occurences that may miltigate a digital project
       at the live stage, An over crowded website would have uncontrolable amount of traffic
       which would affect usere experience and may resulting into down time for the website .

        </p>

    <p>
 <h4>Factors to consider when selection a IT system for a job</h4>
 Selection of the right IT system requires some considerations such as
 <br> 
 Target Audience or Customer -of a business or organisation
 should be put into consideration
 before selecting an IT system to enable maximum user experience and profit.
 <br>
 Type of Job/Business/Organisation- also the type of job,
 task and functionality involved is another consideration to select an IT system.
 <br>
 Traffic - This refers to the level of crowd or users
 that may be involved to consider the right 
 technology to best serve them without difficulties.
 <br>
 Cost- Also the revenue dictates the resourcesin making any decision of right 
 technology to suit a job this
 should be considered aiming at cost effectiveness .

    <h4>Analysis on how chosen technologies have helped to achieve positive outcomes </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>Trello</li>   
    The success of my project was orchestrated by the Trello which was used in  
    planning, mapping , development and execution stage.
    Trello allows me to visualize my ideas and content of the website giving me
    a good management of my time  to enable me to meet the deadline for the project .
 <li>Git and GitHub</li>
 Git and GitHub is equipped with essentials like repositories, 
 branches, commits, and Pull Requests which made  it easy for me to have a
 continuous workflow  mode during the course of the project , Being able to push  my codes
 on GitHub which serves as a transport medium enabled me to carry on working on them 
 from home before coming to codenation.  it saves me time and contributed to the beauty
 of the website giving a hassle free workflow .
 GitHub was also used to host/publish 
 the entire website after completion which I found really amazing .

 the accessibility and functionality of a digital project one of such is the 
 <ab title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</ab> apples to any company or organisation
 that uses data to offer goods and services or involved in data sharing and storing
