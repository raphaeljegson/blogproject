        <h2>Describing content and layout of each page</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>
                My home page was used more in selling myself talking about myself , my qualifications and my strength . I then proceeded to to answer the questions on the unit . 
                The layout on this page was colourful and just a title and explain methodology as planned on my Trello .  
                I have used more images on the home page to meet that plan of being colourful and appealing to the eyes to read  not forgetting my decision  
                to use to a font size and family that is bold and attractive. 
                </li>
                <li>
                        Second page was more of about the IT tools I have selected  reasons why and  the benefit of using them. 
                </li>
                <li>
                        On the third page I made a image representation of all my collaborative tools explaining how they look and impact of
                        the process of transitioning of all stages of my project. 
                </li>
                <li>
                Fourth page was my test page revealing images of the test outcome of 
                my website on various platforms and operating systems also showing 
                what impact each Operating system as on the website design.

                <li>
                        The last page was the reference page  which comprises of all 
                        the links to the references websites I have used on the project.

      <h2> Describe copyright and other constraint affecting website </h2>
      <p>
            The Internet has changed the way in which people seek and 
            publish information, making it important to understand the ways in which copyright
             laws affect Internet use. Internet-based businesses and businesses that use the Internet for 
             promotion and publication of information should be aware not only of how to avoid copyright infringement, but also of the protections 
            copyright laws afford to website operators.
      </p>
          <h3>Copyright Law Basics</h3>
        <p> 
                Copyright protection is automatic for any creative work that is 
                created after 1978 and fixed in some tangible form. You don't have to display a copyright symbol 
                or register rights to your item for it to receive copyright protection. For this reason, you should assume all content on the Web is copyrighted unless it explicitly 
                states otherwise this restricts and bind any website creator or data user to use contents from the 
                internet as they are all protected by copy right this in return makes 
                 difficult the  information gathering  stage.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Fair Use </h3>
        <p> 
                The "Fair Use Doctrine" provides an exception to copyright laws for
                 scholarly and educational purposes. Fair use permits people to take limited excerpts 
                 of works for articles, critiques and other public services. Parodies of copyrighted works are also generally protected. 
                 There is no standard excerpt that is permissible under law, and guidelines about fair use are relatively unspecific. If your small business has had copyrighted material copied from your website, 
                 courts examine the purpose of the use of copyrighted work, the financial effect the use has on the copyright holder, the degree to which an item was excerpted and the nature of the copyrighted work when determining whether a 
                 violation has occurred. For example,
                  a person cannot excerpt a photo, so re-posting a photo from your website might constitute copyright infringement, but excerpting a 
                line from a book you sale might not.  
        </p>

        <h3>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h3>
       <p> 
            The Digital Millennium Copyright Act removes liability from websites whose users commit copyright infringement so 
            long as the websites take the material down. This means that even if YouTube or Facebook allows you to upload something on your small business page,
             you could still be committing copyright infringement and the material can be removed. Some Internet users believe that if they state that no copyright infringement was 
             intended they might escape liability. For example, people frequently re-post songs on YouTube with a disclaimer stating they are not violating copyright laws. This does not, however, absolve users from liability, 
             so it is important to check the copyright status of any material you upload to a websiteâ€™s of website development as resources are 
            limited and protected from usage .  
       </p>

       <h3>Illegal Downloads</h3>

       <p>
            Illegal downloads have cost musicians, authors and other creative 
            professionals millions of dollars. It is illegal to download or upload copyrighted material,
             such as books, songs and movies without the explicit permission of the copyright holder. The Recording Industry 
             Association of America has sued many individuals for illegal downloads. If you plan to use music on your business website, ensure that you obtain 
             the music legally and that you have permission to use the music.
       </p>

        <h3> Preventing Infringement</h3>

        <p>
                The simplest way to avoid infringing on another person or business' copyrights is to seek permission 
                to use anything that is not yours. Even using a photographer's photo on a personal blog could constitute 
                copyright infringement. If you are concerned about your copyrights being infringed upon, insert watermarks and upload material 
                in formats that are difficult to copyright, PDF files. There is no guaranteed method for preventing infringement, but registering 
                your copyrights and prominently displaying a copyright symbol can deter would-be thieves.

        <h2>  Web Accessibility - Common Problems People with Disabilities Face with using Websites</h2>
         <p>
                This document lists the problems that people with disabilities can experience when trying to view a website.
         </p>
                <h3>Blindness</h3>
                <p>
                                Makes it impossible to view a standard screen display or printed output. 
                                A person who is blind often will use a speech output system (e.g., 
                                screen reader) to read aloud text that is presented on the screen; this system may be composed of 
                                screen reading software and a voice synthesizer. S/he may or may not be able to use a Braille output system, (e.g., 
                                refreshable Braille displays that allow line-by-line translation of a screen into a Braille display areas). Scanners with optical 
                                character recognition (OCR) that can read printed material and store it electronically where it can be read 
                                using speech output or Braille may also be used to read web documents.
                                People who are blind cannot view the graphical features of your Web site. Many people with visual loss use 
                                voice output programs with nonstandard browsers (such as pwWebSpeak 
                                or Lynx) or graphical browsers with the feature that loads images turned off. Include text 
                                equivalents or text alternatives to make the content in graphical features accessible.
                </p>

                <h3>Vision loss</h3>

                <p> 
                                Including hazy vision, low vision color blindness, 
                                tunnel vision, near sightedness have challenges with low or poor 
                                color contrasts, small icons and type faces. Large monitors and anti-glare screens, screen enlarger software, 
                                color and contrast adjustments, speech output systems and scanners with optical character recognition are adaptive 
                                equipment used to navigate the web or reach web output.
                </p>

                <h3>Color blindness</h3>
                <p>
                        Creates difficulty with poor contrast between the colors used 
                        in text and their background, as well as navigation bars and buttons. 
                        Use of color alone to convey information (e.g,, all items in red are 20% discounted) 
                        may not be usable for a person with color blindness. 
                </p>
                <h3>Deaf or Hard of Hearing</h3>
                <p>May prevent a significant population from hearing your audible 
                material, including computer prompts. A deaf or hard of hearing computer user 
                may replace the computer prompt or tone with a flash, using options in the operating system.
                The causes and degrees of hearing loss vary. 
                </p>

                <h3>Physical disabilities</h3>
                <p>
                        Impacting mobility may be orthopaedic or neuromuscular such as carpal tunnel, 
                        various forms of arthritis, cerebral palsy, stroke, muscular dystrophy, arthritis 
                        amputation or spinal cord injury. People with physical disabilities may have difficulty using a keyboard, 
                        or find it difficult or impossible to use a mouse, and will need to rely on the keyboard for Web browsing. Some people will use adaptive technology with their computer to access the Web. Less severe disabilities could make the task of highlighting, manipulating pull-down boxes or mouse clicks difficult.
                </p>
                <h3>Learning disabilities</h3>
                <p>
                        Are often considered to be a hidden disability in that it is not obvious in terms of physical appearances. A person with a learning disability may not appear to have a disability, however they may need assistive equipment to support reading, writing and organizational skills. Differences in processing memory, auditory, visual and linguistic or the speed of processing information are symptoms. Enlarged screen display, alternative color contrasts, speech output or reading systems incorporating OCR and speech output are examples of hardware and software used by people with learning disabilities. 
                        Individuals with learning disabilities may have difficulty with a web site that does not use clear language, has complex vocabulary or sentences. A web page that is not logically structured will present a barrier. Adaptive computer equipment may be used as an alternative way of completing tasks such as reading and comprehension. Therefore, web barriers for deaf and blind populations will also affect populations with learning disabilities. Presenting material in more than one format (print, audio and video) provides alternative ways of learning while assisting people with learning disabilities.
