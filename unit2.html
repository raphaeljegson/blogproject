        <h1>Unit 2</h1>

        <h2>Describing content and layout of each page</h2>
        <p>
                My home page was used more in selling myself talking about myself , my qualifications and my strength . I then proceeded to to answer the questions on the unit . 
                The layout on this page was colourful and just a tittle and  explain methodology as planned on my Trello .  
                I have used more images on the home page to meet that plan of being colourful and appealing to the eyes to read  not forgetting my decision  
                to use to a font size and family that is bold and attractive . 
        </p>
        <p>
                Second page was more of about the IT tools I have selected  reasons why and  the benefit of using them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
                On the third page I made a image representation of all my collaborative tools explaining how they look and impact of
                 the process of transitioning of all stages of my project . 
        </p>
        <p>
                Fourth page was my test page   revealing images of the test outcome of 
                my website on various platforms and operating systems also showing 
                what impact each Operating system as on the website design . 
        </p>
       <p>
            he last page was the reference page  which comprises of all 
            the links to 
            the references websites I have used on the project .

      <h2> Describe copyright and other constraint affecting website </h2>
      <p>
            The Internet has changed the way in which people seek and 
            publish information, making it important to understand the ways in which copyright
             laws affect Internet use. Internet-based businesses and businesses that use the Internet for 
             promotion and publication of information should be aware not only of how to avoid copyright infringement, but also of the protections 
            copyright laws afford to website operators.
      </p>
          <h2>Copyright Law Basics</h2>
        <p> 
                Copyright protection is automatic for any creative work that is 
                created after 1978 and fixed in some tangible form. You don't have to display a copyright symbol 
                or register rights to your item for it to receive copyright protection. For this reason, you should assume all content on the Web is copyrighted unless it explicitly 
                states otherwise this restricts and bind any website creator or data user to use contents from the 
                internet as they are all protected by copy right this in return makes 
                 difficult the  information gathering  stage.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Fair Use </h2>
        <p> 
                The "Fair Use Doctrine" provides an exception to copyright laws for
                 scholarly and educational purposes. Fair use permits people to take limited excerpts 
                 of works for articles, critiques and other public services. Parodies of copyrighted works are also generally protected. 
                 There is no standard excerpt that is permissible under law, and guidelines about fair use are relatively unspecific. If your small business has had copyrighted material copied from your website, 
                 courts examine the purpose of the use of copyrighted work, the financial effect the use has on the copyright holder, the degree to which an item was excerpted and the nature of the copyrighted work when determining whether a 
                 violation has occurred. For example,
                  a person cannot excerpt a photo, so re-posting a photo from your website might constitute copyright infringement, but excerpting a 
                line from a book you sale might not.  
        </p>

        <h2>Digital Millennium Copyright Act  </h2>
       <p> 
            The Digital Millennium Copyright Act removes liability from websites whose users commit copyright infringement so 
            long as the websites take the material down. This means that even if YouTube or Facebook allows you to upload something on your small business page,
             you could still be committing copyright infringement and the material can be removed. Some Internet users believe that if they state that no copyright infringement was 
             intended they might escape liability. For example, people frequently re-post songs on YouTube with a disclaimer stating they are not violating copyright laws. This does not, however, absolve users from liability, 
             so it is important to check the copyright status of any material you upload to a websiteâ€™s of website development as resources are 
            limited and protected from usage .  
       </p>

       <h2>Illegal Downloads</h2>

       <p>
            Illegal downloads have cost musicians, authors and other creative 
            professionals millions of dollars. It is illegal to download or upload copyrighted material,
             such as books, songs and movies without the explicit permission of the copyright holder. The Recording Industry 
             Association of America has sued many individuals for illegal downloads. If you plan to use music on your business website, ensure that you obtain 
             the music legally and that you have permission to use the music.
       </p>

        <h2> Preventing Infringement</h2>

        <p>
                The simplest way to avoid infringing on another person or business' copyrights is to seek permission 
                to use anything that is not yours. Even using a photographer's photo on a personal blog could constitute 
                copyright infringement. If you are concerned about your copyrights being infringed upon, insert watermarks and upload material 
                in formats that are difficult to copyright, PDF files. There is no guaranteed method for preventing infringement, but registering 
                your copyrights and prominently displaying a copyright symbol can deter would-be thieves.
