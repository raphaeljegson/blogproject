        <h2>Describing content and layout of each page</h2>
        <p>
                My home page was used more in selling myself talking about myself , my qualifications and my strength . I then proceeded to to answer the questions on the unit . The layout on this page was colourful and just a tittle and  explain methodology as planned on my Trello .  I have used more images on the home page to meet that plan of being colourful and appealing to the eyes to read  not forgetting my decision  to use to a font size and family that is bold and attractive .

                Second page was more of about the IT tools I have selected  reasons why and  the benefit of using them.
