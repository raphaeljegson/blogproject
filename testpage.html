            Below is a test preview of my website on Chrome which 
            shows some inconsistency with the picture size and text area
            there was a bit of space between the home page pics and the text
            that was allign underneath it . 
            How ever all other fucntionality and feature worked well 
            i also found out that the graphic quality on Chrome is abit dull.
