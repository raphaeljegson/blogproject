         <h3>Benefits and drawbacks of IT tools</h3>
         <br>
     <p>
       The benefit of the IT tools selected are numerous and these as been mentioned
       on previous page2 the tool have been beneficial towards
       <ul>
       <li>The planning of the project (Trello)</li>
       <li>time management for the project to meet submision deadline</li>
       <li>Coding/Programming/Designing and Execution of the project (HTML,CSS,Visual studio Code</li>
       <li>Hosting,Continuity,Perfromance Monitoring (git GitHub) </li>
       </ul>
       <img src="Trello.png" alt="Trello" >
       <br>

    The bad sides of the selected IT tools are mainly from the fact that 
    they are Native platform Tools which mean thier function is restricted to 
    the Apple device which means i have to learn how to use another version of 
    these tools on other platforms which can confuse a system of assimilation of
     anyone learning .

       <h3> Could you have done it in teams? </h3>
      I believe ajdnling this project as an individual as helped more rather 
      than doing it in a team. Single handedly handling this project 
      as given the chance to learn at full lenght the 
      basic functionalitys of the IT tool in use
      doing this porject alos allowed me to showcase my creativity rathert han
      confining to a group idea .

      <h3> Best ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
        The biggest challenges of this project was time 
        and limited IT tools which did not allow for experimenting
        and trying out other tools to know which woiuld have been best 
        adapted for teh project. The time to practice before actual project was insufficient 
        making it more of a trail or challenge project .

    </div>
        
       <h3>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
 <div>
       Ideally the use of Trello, Slack and GitHub towards 
       any digital project is paramount but it could be more 
       better if other expertise are involved in a didgital 
       project, for example some expert from a third party 
       organisation who is specialised in image or graphics creation 
       which would help in creating desired logos, images and designs
        which can be used for a digital project rather than
         having to source this image or graphical representation 
         via the google which could have legal impact of copy right 
         on this project . 
         would also be very efficient if theres is enough time to learn 
          and use javascript effectively to create more live feel
           and actual functionality on the project .

      <h3>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>

      All digital solution should be able to work with out defect on all Operating systems
     and platforms 
     All digital project should be tested for performance making sure 
     all the fucntionaly and featurs work as programmed and specified.
      I shal be testing my website on Firefox and Google Chrome to show charset 
      its compartibility on them . 
      My website will be pushed on GitHub and repositries will reveal
       the process of changes and correction made towards the coding.
